To build the code, use make:
$ make

c++11 is needed for proper compilation.

To run the code:

$ ./run.sh 0 # run the program using default options
$ ./run.sh 1 # run the program using optirun (on optimus systems)
$ ./run.sh 2 # run tests
$ ./run.sh 3 # generate humanoid model
$ ./run.sh 4 # generate r2d2 model

You may need give execute permissions to the run.sh script. 
$ chmod +x run.sh 

Alternatively, you can cd into the `build' directory and use either
$ ./assignment_04
or
$ optirun ./assignment_04
